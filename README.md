# ShallowChrome

## About
This repository contains the implementation of the `ShallowChrome` modeling pipeline presented in the paper:
```Frasca F., Matteucci M., Leone M., Morelli M. J. and Masseroli M. "Accurate and highly interpretable prediction of gene expression from histone modifications", 2020```.
`ShallowChrome` is a novel computational pipeline for accurate and fully interpretable modeling of epigenetic gene transcriptional regulation operated by Histone Mark (HM) modifications. `ShallowChrome` leverages on the procedure of 'peak calling' to retrieve gene-wise, significant and dynamically located HM features that can strongly predict the transcriptional state of genes. In our modeling pipeline we:
- Fit logistic regression models on these extracted features to solve the task of binary classification of gene transcriptional state over 56 cell-types from the REMC database;
- Analyse and rigorously interpret the obtained models by extracting insightful gene-specific regulative patterns;
- Compare the extracted patterns with the characteristic chromatin state emissions from ChromHMM (Ernst et al., 2012), showing that `ShallowChrome` is able to coherently rank groups of chromatin states w.r.t. their transcriptional activity. 

More on how to replicate paper results is in the following.

- `LICENSE` MIT license file
- `.gitignore` standard .gitignore file for Python projects
- `notebooks/` folder containing Python notebooks to run the modeling pipeline
- `notebooks/utils.py` core Python routines called from within the notebooks to perform modeling and analyses

- `notebooks/model inspection.ipynb` notebook to inspect ShallowChrome models and to extract and plot gene-wise regulative patterns; reproduces Figure 3 of the paper
- `notebooks/model validation.ipynb` notebook to compare ShallowChrome regulative patterns with ChromHMM chromatin state emissions; reproduces Figure 4 of the paper
- `notebooks/model fitting - valley thresholding.ipynb` here the classification task is solved with an alternative approach to define target classes; reproduces Table S4 and Figures S2 and S3 of the paper
- `scores/` default folder where numerical results from the modeling pipeline are stored

## Requirements
In order to run the `ShallowChrome` model fitting and analyses, the following libraries are required:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit
- scipy
- jupyter

We suggest installing them within a python virtual environment via pip. 
Paper results can be reproduced with the following versions on `Python 2.7.15`:
```
matplotlib==2.2.4      
numpy==1.16.6     
scikit-learn==0.20.4     
scipy==1.2.2      
```

## Reproducing paper results
1. Download the pre-processed data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iJugXgMrtt5pOm2azPhWsIBuxx5TgnuD?usp=sharing);
2. Uncompress the downloaded ".zip" file here in this folder â€“ or wherever you prefer;
3. Run the `notebooks/model fitting.ipynb` notebook to reproduce Tables 2, S1 and Figure 2 of the paper;
4. Run the `notebooks/model inspection.ipynb` notebook to reproduce Figure 3 of the paper;
5. Run the `notebooks/model inspection.ipynb` notebook with variable `target_only` set to `False`: this will perform model selection and fitting for _all_ epigenomes over the 'standard' DeepChrome split, dumping all fitted models to disk;
6. Run the `notebooks/model validation.ipynb` notebook to reproduce Figure 4 of the paper;
7. Run the `notebooks/model fitting - valley thresholding.ipynb` notebook to reproduce Table S4 and Figures S2, S3 of the paper.

NB: If you have not placed the preprocessed data in this folder, then simply change variable `data_base_path` in the notebooks to match your data location.
